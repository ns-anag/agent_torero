## Release Notes - Improved Session Reliability for Cloud Storage Users
This update resolves an issue where sessions for applications like WhatsApp Web would fail to resume correctly after a period of inactivity when cloud storage was enabled. Session data is now loaded more reliably, preventing users from being unexpectedly logged out and asked to re-authenticate.

## Executive Summary
This pull request addresses a critical race condition (RBI-36337) where asynchronous cloud storage restoration failed to complete before the browser engine initialized, causing session data to be lost. The proposed solution reverts the storage import to a synchronous, blocking operation. This change directly resolves the reported bug by ensuring data integrity at session startup.

While this simplification enhances reliability and maintainability, it introduces a performance trade-off by blocking the main thread. The risk is assessed as **Medium** due to the potential for increased session load times, especially on slow networks or with large storage profiles. The change is architecturally consistent with existing synchronous patterns within the session manager. Approval is recommended pending performance validation as outlined in the testing recommendations.

## Objective
The primary objective, as defined in Jira ticket RBI-36337, is to fix a session resumption failure in applications like WhatsApp. The root cause was identified as a race condition where the browser tab would be created with an empty storage profile because the asynchronous import of session data from cloud storage had not yet completed. The goal is to enforce a strict order of operations: storage restoration must fully complete *before* the browser tab is initialized.

## Pull Request Objectives
The PR aims to resolve the race condition by converting the web storage restoration process from an asynchronous task into a direct, synchronous call. This is achieved by modifying the `RSession` and `RSessionTab` classes to block tab creation until the storage import is finished, thereby guaranteeing that the browser engine starts with the correct session data. The changes are localized to the session management components and simplify the codebase by removing asynchronous handling logic.

## Pull Request Diversions
There are no diversions from the stated objective. The PR is a focused and precise implementation that directly addresses the root cause outlined in the Jira ticket without introducing any scope creep.

## Knowledge Retrieval Insights
The codebase analysis confirms this change is a sound architectural decision. The modification in `RSessionTab::startCreate` to make `waitForStorageRestore()` a blocking call is the core of the fix. This approach aligns with existing synchronous waiting patterns in the codebase, such as `RSession::waitForRegistration`, which ensures that the new code follows established conventions for handling critical initialization dependencies. The change simplifies the logic in `rsession.h` by removing the need to manage a `std::future`, which improves long-term code clarity and maintainability.

## Risk Assessment
**Risk:** **Medium**

**Justification:** The risk is not in the correctness of the fixâ€”the synchronous approach is a robust solution to the race condition. The risk is in the performance implications. By converting an asynchronous operation into a blocking call on the session creation path, we are introducing latency that will directly impact the user's perceived session load time. This impact could be significant for users with large storage profiles or poor network conditions. While the change improves reliability, it does so at a potential cost to user experience, which must be quantified and deemed acceptable.

## Areas of Concern
1.  **Performance Impact Quantification:** The primary concern is the unmeasured performance impact. The duration of the synchronous `restoreCacheFolder` call will now directly add to the session startup time. It is critical to measure this latency across various scenarios (e.g., different storage sizes, simulated network conditions) to ensure it remains within an acceptable threshold.
2.  **Error Handling and Timeouts:** The change introduces a blocking call. We need to verify how the system behaves if the storage import fails or times out. Does the session creation process hang, or does it fail gracefully with clear error logging? The resilience of this critical path needs to be confirmed.

## Testing Recommendations
**Existing Tests to Execute:**
*   **ID: C6234, Title: Verify CEF initialization with pre-existing storage**
*   **ID: C4812, Title: Verify session resumption with cloud storage enabled**
*   **ID: C4813, Title: Verify web storage integrity after session resumption**
*   **ID: C5109, Title: Negative Test: Session resumption with corrupted storage**

**Proposed New Tests:**
*   **ID: New, Title: Verify synchronous storage import prevents race conditions**
    *   **Summary:** This test will confirm that the browser tab creation strictly waits for the web storage import to complete. It can be validated by instrumenting the code or using logs to ensure the 'Tab_Create' event always occurs after the 'storage->importFiles' event has finished, directly proving the race condition is resolved.
*   **ID: New, Title: Measure performance impact of synchronous storage import**
    *   **Summary:** This test will measure the session startup time before and after the change to quantify the performance impact of the synchronous blocking call. The startup time should remain within an acceptable threshold.
*   **ID: New, Title: Validate session resumption on storage-heavy applications**
    *   **Summary:** This test will use a complex web application that heavily relies on web storage (similar to WhatsApp Web) to verify that a long-running session can be successfully resumed after a prolonged period of inactivity, confirming the fix for the specific issue reported in RBI-36337.

## Other Recommendations
- **Add Telemetry:** Implement monitoring around the `CEFWebStorage::restoreCacheFolder` function to track its execution time in production. This data will be invaluable for understanding real-world performance impact and identifying potential optimizations in the future.
- **Update Design Documentation:** Any internal architectural documents describing the session initialization flow should be updated to reflect the change from an asynchronous to a synchronous storage import model.
