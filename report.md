## Release Notes - Introduces automatic tab eviction to improve performance and reduce memory usage.
## Executive Summary
This pull request successfully implements the tab eviction feature as specified in ticket RBI-38572. The primary goal is to reduce the application's memory footprint by intelligently closing inactive tabs. This is a significant, full-stack change that modifies the communication protocol, provider backend, browser process, and client-side web application. The implementation introduces a new `Evicted` state into the tab lifecycle, which is consistently handled from the backend state machine to the client UI. Analysis of the codebase confirms that the new logic adheres to existing architectural patterns for tab management, which is commendable. While the core feature is well-implemented, the change is broad and includes several minor code quality refactorings that slightly expand its scope. The overall risk is assessed as Medium due to the complexity of the eviction selection logic and the potential impact on user experience if a tab is closed incorrectly.

## Objective
Based on Jira ticket RBI-38572, the objective is to implement a complete tab eviction mechanism to conserve memory. This involves:
1.  Developing logic within the provider to identify and mark inactive tabs for eviction.
2.  Sending an order to the browser process (CEF) to destroy the targeted tab.
3.  Notifying the client application to update the UI, indicating the tab has been closed due to inactivity.
4.  Creating a session command to manually trigger the eviction process for testing and validation.

## Pull Request Objectives
The pull request aims to add support for evicting a tab by orchestrating communication between the provider, the browser manager, and the client. The provider first instructs the browser manager to close the tab to free up system resources. Subsequently, it notifies the client to provide appropriate visual feedback to the user and halt the web application within that tab.

## Pull Request Diversions
The PR successfully meets its primary objectives but also includes several minor, beneficial refactorings that are outside the immediate scope of the feature request. These are positive changes for code health but increase the review surface area.
*   **Dependency Injection:** Introduced an `ICfgMgrUpdater` interface to decouple the configuration manager.
*   **LRU Cache Refactor:** Simplified the `UnboundedLRU` cache implementation by removing timestamp logic.
*   **C++ Modernization:** Made several small-scale improvements, such as using `emplace_back` over `push_back`, marking a constructor `explicit`, using `override` on a virtual destructor, and making a function `inline`. These are good practices but not directly related to the eviction logic.

## Knowledge Retrieval Insights
The implementation aligns well with established patterns in the existing codebase, which is a strong positive for long-term maintainability.
*   **State Machine Consistency:** The new `State_Evicted` is added to the provider's `RSessionTab::State` enum, and a corresponding `Evicted` status is added to the `TabStatus` protocol enum. This mirrors how existing states like `Closing`/`Closed` are handled.
*   **Architectural Pattern Reuse:** The new `Tab_Evict` function in `RBrowsingSession` follows the same three-step pattern as the existing `Tab_Close` function: (1) update the internal state, (2) send a command to the browser process, and (3) send a status update to the client.
*   **Command Handling:** The new test command for eviction is integrated into the existing `switch` statement in `RAppSessionMessage`, the central dispatcher for session commands. This demonstrates a clean integration into the server's command processing infrastructure.
*   **Client-Side Logic:** The new `evict` function on the client-side `RTab` object mirrors the existing `close` function by calling `stopWebApp()` before updating the UI, ensuring consistent behavior.

## Risk Assessment
**Risk:** Medium

**Justification:** The change is extensive and touches critical, user-facing components across the entire application stack. The core of the risk lies in the new candidate selection logic (`getEvictionCandidateTab`). A flaw in this algorithm could lead to a negative user experience by closing a tab the user perceives as active or, conversely, failing to evict tabs when memory pressure is high. While unit and functional tests have been added, the complexity and potential impact of an error in a production environment warrant a Medium risk rating.

## Areas of Concern
1.  **Eviction Candidate Logic:** The algorithm in `rsession.cpp` that selects a tab for eviction is the most critical and sensitive part of this change. It must correctly balance inactivity time against factors like active file transfers. This logic requires exhaustive testing under various edge cases to prevent unintended data loss or user frustration.
2.  **State Management Complexity:** Introducing a new terminal state (`Evicted`) alongside `Closed` adds complexity to the tab state machine. We must ensure that all related subsystems, especially resource cleanup and session management, correctly handle this new state and do not contain implicit assumptions that tabs are only ever `Closed`.
3.  **Scope of Change:** While the included refactorings are beneficial, bundling them with a large feature implementation makes the PR harder to review and increases the risk of introducing unrelated issues. For future changes of this scale, non-essential refactoring should be addressed in separate, dedicated pull requests.

## Testing Recommendations
The following test cases, combining existing regression tests and newly proposed scenarios, should be executed to ensure full coverage of the new feature.

**Existing Test Cases:**
*   **C2411458:** Verify automatic tab eviction during navigation with several tabs.
*   **C2411461:** Verify no automatic tab eviction with downloads/uploads in progress.
*   **C2411462:** Verify tab is automatically reloaded when a user returns focus to a previously evicted tab.
*   **C2071436:** Verify that a user can close the expired/evicted tab using the 'Close' button or the 'X' icon, and that clicking elsewhere on the page does not dismiss the message.

**Proposed New Test Cases:**
*   **Verify Correct Tab is Chosen for Eviction:** Create a session with three tabs (A, B, C). Access them in the order A, C, B. This makes tab A the least recently used. Trigger the eviction mechanism and verify that only tab A is evicted and closed.
*   **Verify End-to-End Tab Eviction Flow:** In a multi-tab session, identify the least recently used tab. Trigger the eviction command. Verify that the provider sends an eviction order to the browser, the browser closes the tab, and the client receives a notification and displays the 'evicted tab' user interface.
*   **Verify Tab with Active Transfer is Not Evicted:** Create a session with three tabs (A, B, C). Access them in the order A, C, B, making A the LRU tab. Start a file download or upload in tab A. Trigger the eviction mechanism and verify that tab C (the next LRU candidate) is evicted instead of tab A.

## Other Recommendations
- **Documentation:** The new session command (`te`) and the client-side debug console command (`rbi.debug.tabs.evict()`) should be documented in our internal developer and QA guides to facilitate testing.
- **Monitoring:** Implement and monitor metrics for the number of tabs evicted per session and the reasons for eviction. This data will be invaluable for tuning the eviction thresholds and understanding the feature's real-world impact.
- **Follow-up Ticket:** A follow-up technical story should be created to analyze the performance characteristics of the eviction-scanning logic under heavy session load (e.g., a session with 50+ tabs).
